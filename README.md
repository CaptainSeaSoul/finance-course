# Finance Course
 
 This project implements a platform with one finance course. The course has interactive tasks to help learn finance better. Tasks are implemented with Blazor server and are loaded dynamically.
 Please remember that my expertise in finance does not allow me to teach it. The goal is to show my programming skills.
 
 Technologies, frameworks:
 * asp.net core 5.0 + Identity
 * blazor server (to implement tasks)
 * literally canves
 * chart.js
 * DB
 * alpaca API

Tasks are at Areas->Tools
